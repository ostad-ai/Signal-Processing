# Signal Processing
1) Discrete-time **unit impulse** function and its **sifting property**.
2) Discrete-time **unit step** function and its relation to *unit impulse*.
3) The definition of **systems** and **signals**. Also, we review the **linear time-invariant (LTI)** systems.
4) Expressing the output of an **LTI** system using **discrete convolution** and **impulse response**.
5) Continuous-time **unit impulse** and continuous-time **unit step** along with the **sifting property** are reviewed.
6) **Fourier series**: **Exponential** and **sine-cosine** forms with some examples are included.
7) Using **z-transform** for implementing **convolution**.
8) **Discrete-time Fourier transform** (DTFT) is expressed along with some Python code.
9) **Continuous-time Fourier transform** (CTFT) is mentioned here. Also, an example in Python code is included.
10) The **eigenfunctions** and **eigenvalues** for discrete-time LTI systems are demonstrated with z-transform and discrete-time Fourier transform(DTFT).
11) This time, the **eigenfunctions** and **eigenvalues** for **continuous**-time LTI systems are demonstrated with bilateral Lpalace transform and continuous-time Fourier transform(CTFT).
