# Signal Processing
1) Discrete-time **unit impulse** function and its **sifting property**.
2) Discrete-time **unit step** function and its relation to *unit impulse*.
3) The definition of **systems** and **signals**. Also, we review the **linear time-invariant (LTI)** systems.
4) Expressing the output of an **LTI** system using **discrete convolution** and **impulse response**.
5) Continuous-time **unit impulse** and continuous-time **unit step** along with the **sifting property** are reviewed.
